# s404-project
An art project using Processing. Particlesystem that simulates (air / fluid) resistance and gravity causing randomized particles to converge on a pattern,
in this case Î”S, which stands for difference in Entropy. Creates visible lines between particles that are within a set distance of eachother.

Takes much inspiration from Daniel Schiffman's 'The nature of code'.
